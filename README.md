# Pinch (SwiftUI)

Pinch is an iOS app built with SwiftUI to demonstrate handling multiple gestures, including double tap, drag, long tap, and magnify gestures. This project showcases how to effectively implement and combine various gesture recognizers to create a smooth and interactive user experience. Additionally, it integrates animations to enhance the overall responsiveness and aesthetics of the app.
